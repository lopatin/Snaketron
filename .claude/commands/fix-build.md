Do whatever you can do to get the $ARGUMENTS project to compile the most with minimal changes possible.
Try to compile first, and then suggest a list of changes to make to the code to get it to compile.
Use your judgement to remove any unnecessary code or files that are not needed to get the project to compile.
Eliminate back and forth by running a full build on every loop, and suggesting changes for all the errors at once, every loop.
Be able to recognize when you are stuck and not making progress and stop and ask for help.
