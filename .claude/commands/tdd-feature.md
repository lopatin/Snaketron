Act as an expert software engineer and analyze the code to determine what architectural changes, data structure modifications, and implementation updates are required to satisfy the following requirements: $ARGUMENTS

Design Principles:
- Maintain existing high-level architectural patterns and constraints
- Prioritize simplicity, elegance, and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles
- Code should be written so that an AI can easily understand and modify it
- Ensure components integrate seamlessly with minimal coupling
- Request clarification for any ambiguous requirements or implementation details

Development Workflow:

**Phase 1 - Design & Planning**
- Analyze current implementation and identify necessary changes
- Propose data structure modifications and architectural adjustments
- Create detailed implementation plan with clear milestones
- Document testing strategy and edge cases
- Obtain approval before proceeding

**Phase 2 - Test-Driven Development**
- Write comprehensive unit tests for the proposed changes
- Include both positive and negative test cases
- Ensure tests fail initially (red phase of TDD)
- Cover edge cases and boundary conditions

**Phase 3 - Implementation**
- Implement the approved design incrementally
- Follow the agreed-upon architecture strictly
- Ensure all tests pass (green phase of TDD)
- Refactor for clarity and maintainability while keeping tests green
