Act as an expert software engineer and analyze the code to let me know what changes would need to be made in the design of the data structures and code so that the following requirements are met: $ARGUMENTS

- When designing the code, keep in mind that the high level architectural decisions must be adhered to. Also focus on providing a simple and elegant solution that reduces duplication and complexity. The pieces should "fit into place".
- Ask for clarification of my intentions if you are unsure of what I mean or would prefer.

## Phases

- **Phase 1**: Come up with a design and an implementation plan. Get sign-off from me regarding the design and plan for testing.
- **Phase 2**: Implement the unit tests (changes or additions) to test the new design. They should fail because the code is not implemented yet.
- **Phase 3**: Implement the code, adhering to the design agreed on, to make the tests pass.
